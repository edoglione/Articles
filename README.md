# Articles

Here are some article I wrote on Jupyter Notebook:

- <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/Articles/blob/main/lin_car_medium.ipynb"><b>Ground reaction curve for tunnel design in Python</b></a>. In the article I present the basis of the ground reaction curve and its implementation in Python. There is also a small appendix on PLAXIS model calibration (raw data from PLAXIS <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/Articles/blob/main/calibration.csv">here</a>).
- <a href="https://github.com/MarcoTrezzi/Interaction_Domain_for_Piled_Foundations/blob/main/domini_notebook.ipynb"><b>Optimised desing of piles group under eccentric loading</b></a>. The article is written with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-trezzi">Marco Trezzi</a>. The article explains how to create a bearing capacity domain for piles group in Python.<a href="https://github.com/MarcoTrezzi/Interaction_Domain_for_Piled_Foundations">The repository</a> contains also the data frames necessary to run the code.
