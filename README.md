# Articles

Here are some article I wrote on Jupyter Notebook:

- <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/Articles/blob/main/lin_car_medium.ipynb"><b>Ground reaction curve for tunnel design in Python</b></a>. In the article I present the basis of the ground reaction curve and its implementation in Python. There is also a small appendix on PLAXIS model calibration.
